    <h1>SSL Examples</h1>
    You need to run the following command in "client" folder to generate a self-signed SSL certificate.(You do not need to enter any information in the wizard for the command below, just enter through)
    <pre>
    $ openssl req -new -x509 -keyout server.pem -out server.pem -days 365 -nodes
    </pre> Then run the server.py file in "client" folder to run static file server with SSL certificate
    <pre>
        python3 server.py
    </pre> You also need to run the argos with webviz with ssl, edit your .argos file like,

    <pre>
      <webviz 
        ff_draw_frames_every="10" 
        ssl_key_file="client/server.pem"
        ssl_cert_file="client/server.pem"
      />
    </pre> Then you can access the server IP in browser <a href="https://localhost:8000/examples">https://localhost:8000/examples</a> Chrome might ask you to "go back to safety" as the certificate is "self-signed", just proceed anyways.
