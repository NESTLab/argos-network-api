[ ] Documenting Usage (like port,default values) in CLI (Registration of viz)
[ ] Add ping pong to WebSockets to enable testing connection
[ ] Implement ~CWebviz(), Reset(), Destroy() of CWebviz
[ ] Write unit tests
[ ] Check the logic for when the Experiment state is EXPERIMENT_INITIALIZED, EXPERIMENT_DONE
[ ] To document: event is sent in next cycle of broadcast loop (which depends on broadcast frequency)
[ ] Entities to implement:
    [ ] Box with LEDs
    [ ] Footbot (only 3d model is remaining)
    [ ] spiri
    [ ] cylinder with leds
    [ ] camera
    [ ] lua editor
    [ ] floor (loop functions/ floor image)
[ ] draw arena boundaries
[ ] Check if port is already being used
[ ] Add camera configuration through .argos experiment file
[ ] BUG: Reset while fast-forwarding, goes to few steps(instead of 0 steps)
[ ] Do a test for limited number of ticks to check EXPERIMENT_DONE is triggered
